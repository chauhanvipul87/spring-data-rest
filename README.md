# spring-data-rest

This project repository is going to be the master repository for my all spring-data-rest related projects. I'm going to add many projects for the same context starting from basic to advanced level.

I'm really very impressed by the spring data rest technology because REST web services have become the number one means for application integration on the web. In its core, REST defines that a system consists of resources that clients interact with. These resources
are implemented in a hypermedia driven way. Spring MVC offers a solid foundation to build theses kinds of services. But implementing even the simplest tenet of REST web services for a multidomain object system can be quite tedious and result in a lot of boilerplate code.

Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories and automatically exports those as REST
resources. It leverages hypermedia to allow clients to find functionality exposed by the repositories
and integrates these resources into related hypermedia based functionality automatically.

Spring Data REST is itself a Spring MVC application and is designed in such a way that it should
integrate with your existing Spring MVC applications with very little effort. An existing (or future)
layer of services can run alongside Spring Data REST with only minor considerations.
